# Stereo-Vision-and-Dynamic-Programming-in-MATLAB
This project aims to explore the different types of disparity calculation algorithms inclusing Sum of Squared Disparities and Normalized Corss-Correlation. It also uses dynamic programming to see the differences.

## What you'll need:

1. MATLAB R2016a or later

## How to run:

1. Open test_script.m which is the main file. To test SSD, NCC, depth calculation and outlier maps, use this script. Run the whole script and you should see the images in different figures appropriately named.
2. To test dynamic programming and depth recovery, use test_dynamic.m and run.
3. The folder 'output_images' contains my results. Feel free to compare
